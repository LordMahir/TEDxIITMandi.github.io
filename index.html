                  <h4>Percussionist, Composer, Artiste</h4>
                  <hr />
                  Taufiq Qureshi, an ace percussionist of India, referred to as
                  a game changer, is also an acclaimed composer. Taufiq is
                  recognized for his path-breaking and trend-setting work, as a
                  performing artiste and as composer/arranger in the field of
                  world music. Taufiq has been ably successful at taking the
                  nuances of traditional rhythms of India to an alternate form
                  of world music and offering it to a larger audience,
                  comprising all age groups and from different parts of the
                  world. Taufiq has pioneered and developed a distinct technique
                  of playing the African percussion instrument, Djembe, in the
                  context of Indian rhythmic compositions. Taufiq's album
                  Rhydhun, amongst others, is said to be a benchmark for world
                  music in India way back in the year 2000. Taufiq has been
                  featured as a performing artiste in the 2009 Grammy-award
                  winning album, 'Global Drum Project'. Taufiq's albums have
                  been released world over and he has performed at prestigious
                  Music festivals all over the globe. He has been a recipient of
                  the Gold Award for Best Music at the Cannes Ad Film Festival
                  and at the London International Festival for some of his
                  exemplary advertisement ventures. Taufiq has lent a third
                  dimension to many chartbuster songs and background score
                  tracks of the Indian film industry genre of music, by virtue
                  of his inimitable sense of rhythm arrangement and feel for
                  sound. This exceptionally versatile percussionist, is the
                  worthy torchbearer of a rich legacy of percussion, being the
                  son and disciple of the legendary Ustad Allarakha and brother
                  of the maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain by whom he has been greatly
                  influenced. Taufiq has been fortunate to have received
                  guidance from Ghatam Vidhwan, Pandit Vikku Vinayakram. Over
                  the last fifteen years, he has been imparting training to
                  deserving students, some of whom are now making their mark and
                  carrying forward his work.

                  performing artiste and as composer/arranger in the field of
                  world music. Taufiq has been ably successful at taking the
                  nuances of traditional rhythms of India to an alternate form
                  of world music and offering it to a larger audience,
                  comprising all age groups and from different parts of the
                  world. Taufiq has pioneered and developed a distinct technique
                  of playing the African percussion instrument, Djembe, in the
                  context of Indian rhythmic compositions. Taufiq's album
                  Rhydhun, amongst others, is said to be a benchmark for world
                  music in India way back in the year 2000. Taufiq has been
                  featured as a performing artiste in the 2009 Grammy-award
                  winning album, 'Global Drum Project'. Taufiq's albums have
                  been released world over and he has performed at prestigious
                  Music festivals all over the globe. He has been a recipient of
                  the Gold Award for Best Music at the Cannes Ad Film Festival
                  and at the London International Festival for some of his
                  exemplary advertisement ventures. Taufiq has lent a third
                  dimension to many chartbuster songs and background score
                  tracks of the Indian film industry genre of music, by virtue
                  of his inimitable sense of rhythm arrangement and feel for
                  sound. This exceptionally versatile percussionist, is the
                  worthy torchbearer of a rich legacy of percussion, being the
                  son and disciple of the legendary Ustad Allarakha and brother
                  of the maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain by whom he has been greatly
                  influenced. Taufiq has been fortunate to have received
                  guidance from Ghatam Vidhwan, Pandit Vikku Vinayakram. Over
                  the last fifteen years, he has been imparting training to
                  deserving students, some of whom are now making their mark and
                  carrying forward his work.

                  <h4>Percussionist, Composer, Artiste</h4>
                  <hr />
                  Taufiq Qureshi, an ace percussionist of India, referred to as
                  a game changer, is also an acclaimed composer. Taufiq is
                  recognized for his path-breaking and trend-setting work, as a
                  performing artiste and as composer/arranger in the field of
                  world music. Taufiq has been ably successful at taking the
                  nuances of traditional rhythms of India to an alternate form
                  of world music and offering it to a larger audience,
                  comprising all age groups and from different parts of the
                  world. Taufiq has pioneered and developed a distinct technique
                  of playing the African percussion instrument, Djembe, in the
                  context of Indian rhythmic compositions. Taufiq's album
                  Rhydhun, amongst others, is said to be a benchmark for world
                  music in India way back in the year 2000. Taufiq has been
                  featured as a performing artiste in the 2009 Grammy-award
                  winning album, 'Global Drum Project'. Taufiq's albums have
                  been released world over and he has performed at prestigious
                  Music festivals all over the globe. He has been a recipient of
                  the Gold Award for Best Music at the Cannes Ad Film Festival
                  and at the London International Festival for some of his
                  exemplary advertisement ventures. Taufiq has lent a third
                  dimension to many chartbuster songs and background score
                  tracks of the Indian film industry genre of music, by virtue
                  of his inimitable sense of rhythm arrangement and feel for
                  sound. This exceptionally versatile percussionist, is the
                  worthy torchbearer of a rich legacy of percussion, being the
                  son and disciple of the legendary Ustad Allarakha and brother
                  of the maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain by whom he has been greatly
                  influenced. Taufiq has been fortunate to have received
                  guidance from Ghatam Vidhwan, Pandit Vikku Vinayakram. Over
                  the last fifteen years, he has been imparting training to
                  deserving students, some of whom are now making their mark and
                  carrying forward his work.
